#  [6.1] Interconvert Strings and Integers

Implement an integer to string conversion function, and a string to integer conversion function.
For Example, if the input to the first function is the integer 314, it should return the string "314" and if the input to the second function is the string "314" it should return the integer 314.
It should be able to handle negative numbers, and you're not allowed to use library functions like stoi in C++.
